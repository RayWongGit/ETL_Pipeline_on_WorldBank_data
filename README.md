##About this Exercise

In this last exercise, we write a full ETL pipeline for the GDP data. We extract the World Bank data, transform the data, and load the data into a database. We do this all in one go. 

##About ETL

ETL Pipelines involve extracting data from one source, which in this case was a csv file, then transforming the data into a more usable form, and finally loading the data somewhere else.

The purpose of ETL pipelines is to make data more usable and accessible.
